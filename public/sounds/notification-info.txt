For the notification sounds to work properly, you need to add the following MP3 files to this directory:

1. message.mp3 - Sound for new messages
2. invite.mp3 - Sound for new chat invitations 
3. accepted.mp3 - Sound for when a chat invitation is accepted

You can find royalty-free notification sounds on sites like:

- freesound.org
- mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/notification/

Alternatively, convert short sounds to MP3 and add them to this directory.
